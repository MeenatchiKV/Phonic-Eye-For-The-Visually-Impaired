Create a server that can accept image request and perform object detection

In a Virtual Machine,
1. install docker comunity edition
2. install tensorflow serving model server using the following two commands

	docker pull tensorflow/serving
	git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/serving

3. upload the pre-trained model to the following folder in VM

	serving/tensorflow_serving/servables/tensorflow/testdata

4. run the docker container for your model

	#Location of your model
	TESTDATA="$(pwd)/serving/tensorflow_serving/servables/tensorflow/testdata"

	#Run docker
	docker run -t --rm -p 8501:8501 \
   	-v "$TESTDATA/[your_model]:/models/[your_model]" \
   	-e MODEL_NAME=[your_model] \
   	tensorflow/serving &

5. install flask for python to create an intermediate server

	pip install flask

6. Activate the flask server using

	Scripts\activate 

	from the flask folder.

7. Run the img_read.py file from the flask server

	

Good to go!!
